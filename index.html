                    <p id="skills-para-1">The Software Development course with _nology is designed to train me to be a job ready Junior Software Developer. 
                        This was a challenging and rewarding course that I thoroughly enjoyed. I fit the training around my full-time job, studying in the evenings and weekends. 
                        I believe my creative background will be a real asset in my career in Software Development as it will enable me to bring different perspectives to the role. </p>
                    <p class="skills-para">Throughout this course I have built on my basic understanding on HTML and CSS and can now use both languages with confidence to create and style front-end projects. 
                        I have also learnt JavaScript from scratch and gained a level of understanding which has enabled me to complete projects such as a calculator, 
                        a morse code translator, a fully-functioning obstacle game and a space invaders style game as seen above. 
                        I have also learnt the best practices for using JavaScript including Object Orientated Programming (OOP).</p>
                    <p class="skills-para">In addition to this, I have gained confidence using React as a JavaScript framework 
                        and learnt how to interact with APIs and implement them in to projects, 
                        and I have had an introduction to how the back-end works with NodeJS and building a REST API.</p> 
                    <p class="skills-para">I have also gained real work experience by working on a collaborative client project as my final assessment. 
                        Using GitHib and Firebase, I have completed one section of a webpage for a start up in Bristol called Knowaste.</p>
                    <p class="skills-para">I am now proficient in: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, incl. OOP, React, GitHub, Firebase, NoSQL databases, NodeJS, Testing</p>
